PROJECT {"J":["S","O","N"]}
========

PROJECT {"J":["S","O","N"]} is a library for interacting with JSON data in Java. JSON is a data-interchange format for creating and saving information about data structures. It is best read about in detail at its official website, [here](http://www.json.org/).

This library can be used for parsing JSON into simple java objects, and returning the same objects back into JSON notation.

In particular, PROJECT {"J":["S","O","N"]} features:
* Good error checking - improperly formatted JSON input is very clearly marked and has helpful error messages
* Full json support - including special unicode characters and parsing around excess whitespaces
* Can take input from a user, file, string, or url source
